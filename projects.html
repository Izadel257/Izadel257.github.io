        <p>Here are a few selected projects I've worked on. Some are public and open-source, while others are private
            due to confidentiality agreements. Iâ€™ve also included current works in progress to show what Iâ€™m actively
            building and learning.</p>

                    <strong> <a href = "https://www.spaceedafrica.org" target = "_blank">Space-Ed Africa (President)</a></strong><br />
                    I co-founded <a href = "https://www.spaceedafrica.org" target = "_blank">Space-Ed Africa </a></strong>, a community-driven initiative in Burundi focused on empowering youth through skills training, entrepreneurship, and technology.
                     Through programs like our Summer Empowerment Boot Camp, online learning app, mentorship initiatives, and AI-powered projects, we aim to inspire purpose, promote innovation, and support young peopleâ€”especially womenâ€”in redefining their future as job creators and leaders in tech.
                     We are still in our early stages, but we believe a lot in the potential of the project and we are working hard to make it a success. With just one bootcamp, we are already seeing some of our cohort members start their own projects and have impacts in the community.

                            Daemon</a></strong><br />
                            <p>
                            This is a lightweight, real-time Git conflict detector that runs quietly in the background 
                            and gently lets you know before you make changes to files that would result in merge conflicts.

                            <p>
                            It is built with Python and uses the GitPython library to monitor changes in your Git repository.
                            It offers the user the option to ignore the alert and continue working, or pull the latest changes from the remote repository.

                    A Chrome extension that logs job applications to a connected Google Sheet. Built with JavaScript,
                    React, and Google Apps Script. It makes it easy for one to go back and check the jobs they have applied to, update the application status and add notes to the application.

                    <p>
                        I worked with a group of 3 other Carleton Students to explore how reinforcement learning can be applied to the game of Monopoly by designing and comparing three Q-learning agents: a basic Q-table agent, 
                        an approximate Q-learning agent using feature-based generalization, and a deep Q-lambda agent powered by neural networks and eligibility traces. 
                        Each agent was trained to make strategic decisionsâ€”like buying, selling, and holding propertiesâ€”in complex, multi-player environments. 
                        Our goal was to balance learning efficiency, representational complexity, and long-term planning in a game with a rich and dynamic decision space.

                    <strong>Election News Data Analysis Project (Data Scientist, Carleton College)</strong><br />
                    The Election News Analysis project has been angoing for more than 3 years and I was lucky to be one of the people that contributed to it. The project aims to collect transcripts from a range of news sources and analyze the trends and patterns in topics discussed during presidential election periods, as well as during major events that influenced those elections (e.g., the murder of George Floyd, the January 6th Capitol attack).
                    So far, my contribution has been developing end-to-end data pipelines using Python, R, and SQL to extract, transform, and load over two years of news transcripts from NDS databases.
                     I applied advanced data manipulation techniques with Pandas and NumPy to ensure the analysis aligned with project goals, ultimately supporting the 
                     processing of more than 60,000 transcripts. I also managed communications between Carleton faculty and NDS tech support, facilitating seamless collaboration across technical and academic teams.
                      My role included leading data cleaning and transformation efforts, optimizing datasets for efficient and accessible use by end-users.
                      Check out a blog about the project (not the most update but it should give you an idea of what the project is): <a href="https://www.carleton.edu/its/blog/election-news-analysis-project/" target="_blank">Election News Data Analysis</a>.

                    <strong>Toronto Metropolitan University Research</strong><br />
                    I conducted GIS data visualization using R to create interactive, map-based representations that supported environmental research insights. 
                    Working closely with environmental science researchers, I translated their needs into secure and compliant data workflows. 
                    I executed climate data preprocessing tasks using both Python and R, employing techniques such as merging, deduplication, and validation to ensure data accuracy and integrity. 
                    Using Pandas and NumPy, I performed data aggregation, handled missing values, and optimized datasets for analysis. 
                    To ensure transparency and reproducibility, I also developed clear documentation for both the data and code, enabling researchers to easily interpret and build upon the work. My contribution to the project earned me co-authorship to the research.<em>Project is internal.</em>

                    A mobile payment and transaction system of Schillers (a currency that works at Carleton college and other associated service providers) developed using React Native, Flask, and SQLAlchemy.
                    I completed the development of the application and I am currently waiting to get access to the APIs for the payment system and the school authentication system. 
                    I am in touch with the school technology team requesting the API access, and explaining how the  possibility of the application increasing the use of Schillers and the benefits that would come with it.
